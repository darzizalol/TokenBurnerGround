# NIGHTLOG — one entry per night, written by the Release Manager

The morning paper: what shipped, what bounced, what's still open.

---

## 2026-07-18

- **Merged**: PR #1 "Project scaffolding" (`night/20260718-project-scaffolding`)
  — `cinder/` package skeleton (`__init__.py`, `tokens.py` with a
  `TokenType.EOF` stub, `cli.py` argparse entrypoint with `run`/`repl`
  subcommands) plus a passing `tests/` harness. Reviewer gave
  `VERDICT: LGTM`, QA gave `QA: PASS`, both after the sole commit — clean
  merge, no bounces. BACKLOG.md task 1 marked done and remaining tasks
  renumbered; task 1 is now the lexer.
- **Bounced**: none.
- **Still open**: no open PRs.
- First night of Cinder is off to a clean start — scaffolding landed on the
  first pass with no review/QA friction, so the lexer task is unblocked for
  the next Engineer session.

- **Merged**: PR #2 "Lexer: tokenize literals, identifiers, operators,
  comments" (`night/20260718-lexer`) — `cinder/lexer.py`, a fleshed-out
  `TokenType` enum in `cinder/tokens.py`, and `LexError` in
  `cinder/errors.py`, with 19/19 tests passing. Reviewer gave
  `VERDICT: LGTM`, QA gave `QA: PASS`, both after the sole commit — clean
  merge, no bounces. BACKLOG.md task 1 marked done and remaining tasks
  renumbered; task 1 is now the parser.
- **Bounced**: none.
- **Still open**: no open PRs.
- Second PR in a row landed clean on the first pass — the night shift is on
  a roll, two-for-two with no review/QA friction so far.

- **Merged**: PR #3 "Parser: expressions with correct precedence"
  (`night/20260718-parser`) — `cinder/ast_nodes.py`, `cinder/parser.py` (a
  recursive-descent parser with the full precedence chain and
  parenthesized grouping/calls), and `ParseError` in `cinder/errors.py`,
  with 34/34 tests passing. Reviewer gave `VERDICT: LGTM`, QA gave
  `QA: PASS`, both after the sole commit — clean merge, no bounces.
  BACKLOG.md task 1 marked done and remaining tasks renumbered; task 1 is
  now the tree-walking evaluator for expressions.
- **Bounced**: none.
- **Still open**: no open PRs.
- Three for three now — every PR tonight has landed clean on the first
  pass, no review/QA friction at all so far.

- **Merged**: PR #4 "Tree-walking evaluator for expressions"
  (`night/20260718-evaluator-expressions`) — `cinder/interpreter.py` with
  `Environment` (lexical scoping via parent pointer) and
  `Interpreter.evaluate()` covering the full expression AST (arithmetic,
  string concat, comparisons, short-circuit `and`/`or`, unary, grouping,
  identifier lookup), plus `CinderRuntimeError` additions in
  `cinder/errors.py`, with 64 tests passing. Reviewer gave `VERDICT: LGTM`,
  QA gave `QA: PASS`, both after the sole commit — clean merge, no bounces.
  BACKLOG.md task 1 marked done and remaining tasks renumbered; task 1 is
  now statements (`let`, blocks, CLI wiring).
- **Bounced**: none.
- **Still open**: no open PRs.
- Four for four tonight — every PR has landed clean on the first pass, no
  review/QA friction at all so far.

## 2026-07-19

- **Merged**: PR #5 "Statements: let, blocks, and end-to-end CLI wiring"
  (`night/20260718-statements`) — `ExprStmt`/`LetStmt`/`Block` AST nodes,
  parser support for `let` and `{ ... }` blocks plus `parse_program`, and
  `Interpreter.execute(stmt, env)`; wired `cinder/cli.py`'s `run`
  subcommand to lex→parse→execute a `.cin` file end to end, 81 tests
  passing. This branch started as unreviewed WIP rescued after a prior
  session was killed mid-work by the hard stop; this cycle's Engineer
  rebased it onto current `main`, and Reviewer/QA both signed off on the
  rebased result (`VERDICT: LGTM`, `QA: PASS`, both after the sole commit)
  — clean merge, no bounces. BACKLOG.md task 1 marked done and remaining
  tasks renumbered; task 1 is now control flow (`if`/`else`, `while`).
- **Bounced**: none.
- **Still open**: no open PRs.
- Five for five across the two nights so far — the rescued WIP from the
  hard-stop interruption made it through review and QA cleanly on the
  first try, no repeat of the interruption.

- **Merged**: PR #6 "Control flow: if/else and while"
  (`feat/20260719-control-flow`) — `IfStmt`/`WhileStmt` AST nodes, parser
  and evaluator support, and a minimal assignment expression
  (`name = expr`) with `Environment.assign` walking the scope chain to
  mutate `let`-bound variables; truthiness rule (`nil`/`false` falsy,
  everything else including `0`/`""` truthy) pinned in `PROJECT.md`, 96
  tests passing. Reviewer gave `VERDICT: LGTM`, QA gave `QA: PASS`, both
  after the sole commit — clean merge, no bounces. BACKLOG.md task 1
  marked done and remaining tasks renumbered; task 1 is now functions
  (declarations, calls, closures, `return`).
- **Bounced**: none.
- **Still open**: no open PRs.
- Six for six across the two nights now — every PR so far has landed clean
  on first review/QA pass, no bounces at all yet this project.

- **Merged**: none this cycle.
- **Bounced**: PR #7 "Functions: declarations, calls, closures, return"
  (`feat/20260719-functions`) got `VERDICT: CHANGES REQUESTED` (1 of 3) —
  Reviewer found `return` outside a function crashes with a raw internal
  `_ReturnSignal` Python exception instead of a clean `CinderRuntimeError`
  (uncaught in `Interpreter.execute`, no handler in `cinder/cli.py`); no
  QA comment posted yet either. Left on its branch for the next Engineer
  session to fix.
- **Still open**: PR #7, awaiting a fix push.
- First bounce of the project — the streak of clean first-pass merges ends
  at six, but the review process is working as designed (caught a real gap
  in error-diagnostic coverage before it reached `main`).

- **Merged**: PR #7 "Functions: declarations, calls, closures, return"
  (`feat/20260719-functions`) — `FnDecl`/`ReturnStmt` AST nodes, parser
  support for `fn name(a, b) { ... }` and call expressions, and evaluator
  support for first-class functions capturing their defining `Environment`
  (closures), arity-checked calls, recursion, and `return` unwinding via an
  internal control-flow signal. Fix commit (584f6cf) resolved the earlier
  bounce by tracking function-nesting depth in the parser and raising
  `ParseError` for `return` outside a function, with new tests for
  top-level `return`, `return` inside a top-level `if`/`while`, and depth
  resetting after a fn body closes. Reviewer gave `VERDICT: LGTM` and QA
  gave `QA: PASS` on the re-review, both after the fix commit — 114/114
  tests passing. BACKLOG.md task marked done and remaining tasks
  renumbered; task 1 is now data structures (lists and maps).
- **Bounced**: none this cycle (PR #7's single bounce was from the prior
  cycle, fixed and merged this cycle).
- **Still open**: no open PRs.
- Recovered cleanly from the project's first bounce — one round trip
  through Reviewer feedback and the fix landed on the second pass, exactly
  as the process is meant to work.

- **Merged**: PR #8 "Data structures: lists and maps"
  (`feat/20260719-lists-maps`) — `ListLiteral`/`MapLiteral`/`Index`/
  `IndexAssign` AST nodes, parser support for `[1, 2, 3]` and `{"a": 1}`
  literals plus `expr[expr]` get/set indexing (backed by Python
  `list`/`dict`), and a `COLON` token for map-literal syntax. Out-of-range
  list indices, non-int list indices, missing map keys, and unhashable map
  keys raise `CinderRuntimeError` with line/column instead of a raw Python
  exception. `VERDICT: LGTM` and `QA: PASS` both landed after the sole
  commit — clean merge, no bounces (141/141 tests passing). BACKLOG.md
  task marked done and remaining tasks renumbered; task 1 is now standard
  library builtins (`print`, `len`, `type`, conversions).
- **Bounced**: none.
- **Still open**: no open PRs.
- Another clean first-pass merge — Reviewer did flag a pre-existing,
  non-blocking grammar wrinkle (bare map-literal expression statements
  like `{"a": 1};` parse as a block, not a `MapLiteral`, since
  `_statement()` special-cases a leading `{`); noted in BACKLOG.md for
  whoever tackles statement-level map literals. The project is 8 for 9 on
  clean first-pass merges with one bounce recovered in a single round
  trip — the review/QA gate is doing real work without slowing things
  down.

- **Merged**: PR #9 "Standard library: builtins (`print`, `len`, `type`,
  conversions)" (`feat/20260719-builtins`) — `cinder/builtins.py` with
  `print`/`len`/`type`/`str`/`int`/`float` injected into the global
  `Environment`, plus a `_type_name` → `type_name` rename in
  `interpreter.py` so builtins can share it. `VERDICT: LGTM` and
  `QA: PASS` both landed after the sole commit — clean merge, no bounces
  (162/162 tests passing, up from 141 on `main`). Reviewer flagged a
  minor, non-blocking semantic shift (`_evaluate_call` now evaluates
  arguments before the not-callable check, so side effects in args run
  before the error), and QA independently confirmed it wasn't a
  regression. BACKLOG.md task marked done and remaining tasks renumbered;
  task 1 is now error diagnostics polish.
- **Bounced**: none.
- **Still open**: no open PRs.
- Ninth PR, ninth merge with at most one bounce along the way — `.cin`
  scripts can now actually print output, which makes the upcoming example
  programs and REPL tasks meaningfully testable end to end.

- **Merged**: PR #10 "Error diagnostics polish"
  (`fix/20260719-error-diagnostics`) — `cinder/cli.py`'s `run` subcommand
  now catches `CinderError` and prints a one-line `file:line:column:
  message` diagnostic to stderr with a non-zero exit code, instead of
  leaking a raw Python traceback. `VERDICT: LGTM` and `QA: PASS` both
  landed after the sole commit — clean merge, no bounces (166/166 tests
  passing, up from 162 on `main`). QA flagged a non-blocking gap: running
  `run` on a nonexistent file still raises a raw `FileNotFoundError`
  traceback, since that's not a `CinderError` subclass — noted as a
  possible future backlog item, out of scope for this task. BACKLOG.md
  task marked done and remaining tasks renumbered; task 1 is now example
  programs.
- **Bounced**: none.
- **Still open**: no open PRs.
- Tenth PR, tenth merge, all with at most one bounce along the way — the
  CLI no longer leaks Python tracebacks for user-facing script errors,
  which was the last rough edge blocking confident day-to-day use of
  `cinder run`.

- **Merged**: PR #11 "Example programs" (`feat/20260719-example-programs`)
  — `examples/fizzbuzz.cin`, `examples/fibonacci.cin`, and
  `examples/list_ops.cin`, each with a checked-in `.expected` golden-output
  file, plus `tests/test_examples.py` which subprocess-runs every
  `examples/*.cin` file and diffs stdout against its golden file (168
  tests passing, up from 166 on `main`). `VERDICT: LGTM` and `QA: PASS`
  both landed after the sole commit — clean merge, no bounces. QA
  independently confirmed the pre-existing `FileNotFoundError` traceback
  gap (already tracked in BACKLOG.md) is untouched by this PR's diff.
  BACKLOG.md task marked done and remaining tasks renumbered; task 1 is
  now the statement-level map-literal parsing fix.
- **Bounced**: none this cycle.
- **Still open**: no open PRs.
- Eleventh PR, eleventh merge, all with at most one bounce along the way —
  the interpreter pipeline now has end-to-end regression coverage via
  realistic programs, not just unit tests of individual features.

## 2026-07-20

- **Merged**: none this cycle.
- **Bounced**: PR #12 "Fix: statement-level map literals parse as blocks"
  (`fix/20260719-map-literal-stmt`) has one `VERDICT: CHANGES REQUESTED`
  (the speculative parse only tries `_map_literal()`, not a full
  expression, so postfix/binary ops on a leading map literal like
  `{"a": 1}["a"];` still fail to parse) and no QA verdict yet — below the
  3-strike close threshold, left open for the next Engineer session to
  push a fix to the same branch.
- **Still open**: PR #12, awaiting rework per the review comment above.
- Quiet cycle — nothing to merge or close, the one open PR is mid-rework
  and just needs the next Engineer session to broaden the speculative
  parse to a full expression before it can go back to review.

- **Merged**: PR #12 "Fix: statement-level map literals parse as blocks"
  (`fix/20260719-map-literal-stmt`) — after the CHANGES REQUESTED above,
  the Engineer broadened `_brace_statement()`'s speculative parse from a
  bare `_map_literal()` to a full `self._assignment()`, so postfix
  indexing/calls and binary operators on a leading map literal are now
  captured correctly, with tests for all three previously-failing cases.
  `VERDICT: LGTM` and `QA: PASS` both landed after the fix-up push (175
  tests passing). BACKLOG.md task marked done and remaining tasks
  renumbered; task 1 is now the REPL.
- **Bounced this merge cycle**: none (the one CHANGES REQUESTED was from
  the prior cycle, already noted above).
- **Still open**: no open PRs.
- Twelfth PR, twelfth merge — the map-literal-vs-block ambiguity flagged
  back during PR #8's review is fully closed out, and the parser now
  correctly disambiguates the whole leading-`{` expression grammar, not
  just the bare-literal case.

- **Merged**: none this cycle.
- **Bounced**: PR #13 "REPL: interactive read-eval-print loop"
  (`feat/20260719-repl`) has one `VERDICT: CHANGES REQUESTED` (the
  `_needs_more_input` check treats every `LexError` as an unterminated
  string, so an actually-illegal character wedges the REPL into
  buffering forever with no diagnostic until EOF, silently discarding
  everything typed — including valid statements queued after the bad
  line) and no QA verdict yet — below the 3-strike close threshold, left
  open for the next Engineer session to distinguish unterminated-string
  `LexError`s from other lex failures.
- **Still open**: PR #13, awaiting rework per the review comment above.
- Quiet cycle again — one open PR mid-rework, nothing else in flight;
  the next Engineer session just needs to give `LexError` a way to say
  "this isn't a string, stop buffering and report it."

- **Merged**: PR #13 "REPL: interactive read-eval-print loop"
  (`feat/20260719-repl`) — after the CHANGES REQUESTED above, the Engineer
  gave `LexError` an `unterminated: bool` flag set only at the
  unterminated-string sites in `cinder/lexer.py`, so `_needs_more_input` in
  `cinder/repl.py` now only keeps buffering on that flag; an illegal
  character falls through to the normal `CinderError` report-and-continue
  path instead of wedging the loop forever. New regression test
  `test_illegal_character_reports_immediately_and_does_not_wedge` covers
  the reviewer's repro. `VERDICT: LGTM` and `QA: PASS` both landed after
  the fix commit (184/184 tests passing, up from 175 on `main`); QA also
  hand-verified unterminated multi-line strings still buffer correctly (no
  overcorrection) and the non-REPL `run` path is unaffected. BACKLOG.md
  task marked done and remaining tasks renumbered; task 1 is now standard
  library list/map growth and iteration helpers (`push`/`pop`/`keys`/
  `values`).
- **Bounced this merge cycle**: none (the one CHANGES REQUESTED was from
  the prior cycle, already noted above).
- **Still open**: no open PRs.
- Thirteenth PR, thirteenth merge — the interpreter now has an actual
  interactive REPL with no silent-hang failure mode, and the project is
  clear to open on task 1 (list/map helpers) next cycle.

- **Merged**: PR #14 "Standard library: list/map growth and iteration
  helpers" (`feat/20260719-list-map-helpers`) — clean first pass, no
  bounces. Added `push`/`pop`/`keys`/`values` to `cinder/builtins.py`
  (mutating the underlying list/dict in place, consistent with existing
  index-assign reference semantics) plus `examples/collections.cin`
  exercised by the golden-output test harness. `VERDICT: LGTM` and
  `QA: PASS` both landed after the single commit (197 tests passing, up
  from 184). Reviewer's only note was a non-blocking nit: the module
  docstring still doesn't list the new builtins. BACKLOG.md task marked
  done and remaining tasks renumbered; task 1 is now the `run` CLI
  traceback-leak fix for missing/unreadable script paths.
- **Bounced this cycle**: none.
- **Still open**: no open PRs.
- Fourteenth PR, fourteenth merge, first try — collections in Cinder are
  now actually useful (grow, shrink, iterate keys/values) instead of just
  indexable, and the queue is clear for the next Engineer session.

- **Merged**: PR #15 "Fix: `run` leaks raw traceback for missing/unreadable
  script" (`fix/20260719-run-file-open`) — clean first pass, no bounces.
  Catches `OSError` around `run_file`'s `open()` in `cinder/cli.py` and
  prints a one-line `cinder: run: <path>: <reason>` diagnostic to stderr
  with exit code 1 instead of leaking a raw Python traceback, for missing,
  directory, and permission-denied script paths alike; `CinderError`
  handling untouched. `VERDICT: LGTM` and `QA: PASS` both landed after the
  single commit (198 tests passing, up from 197; QA also hand-verified all
  three `OSError` subclasses plus the happy path and the existing
  `CinderError` path via CLI smoke tests). BACKLOG.md task marked done and
  remaining tasks renumbered; task 1 is now string indexing.
- **Bounced this cycle**: none.
- **Still open**: no open PRs.
- Fifteenth PR, fifteenth merge, first try — the last known raw-traceback
  gap in the CLI (flagged back during PR #10's review) is closed, and the
  queue is clear for the next Engineer session to start on string
  indexing.
