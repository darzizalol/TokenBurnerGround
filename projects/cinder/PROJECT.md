# PROJECT.md — Cinder

## Vision

**Cinder** is a small, dynamically-typed scripting language with a
tree-walking interpreter, built entirely from scratch in pure Python (stdlib
only — no parser generators, no third-party packages). It is the product this
repo builds, night after night: lexer, parser, evaluator, standard library,
error diagnostics, and eventually a REPL good enough to actually enjoy using.

The point is depth over breadth. Every night adds one real, tested piece —
never a stub. By the time Cinder is "done" (there is no fixed end; see
Roadmap) it should be a small but complete language: variables, control flow,
functions with closures, lists and maps, a minimal standard library, and
error messages with line/column info that don't embarrass us.

Why a language interpreter: it decomposes naturally into independently
testable, strictly-ordered layers (you cannot parse before you can lex, you
cannot evaluate before you can parse), each layer has an unambiguous
correctness bar (does it produce the right tokens/AST/value?), and it scales
from a one-night task ("add the `%` operator") to a multi-night one ("add
closures") without ever needing paid services, secrets, or deployment.

## Scope & non-goals

In scope: lexer, recursive-descent/Pratt parser, tree-walking evaluator,
scoping, functions/closures, lists/maps, a small builtin standard library,
structured runtime/parse errors, a CLI for running `.cin` scripts, a REPL,
example programs, unit tests for every layer.

Out of scope (do not attempt unless PROJECT.md is amended first): bytecode
VM / JIT, package manager, file I/O or networking builtins, type checker,
LSP/editor tooling, self-hosting Cinder-in-Cinder. These are plausible *future*
directions once the tree-walking interpreter is solid, but they are not
current backlog and must not be started speculatively.

## Architecture

```
cinder/
  __init__.py
  lexer.py        # source text -> list[Token]
  tokens.py        # Token, TokenType definitions
  ast_nodes.py     # AST node dataclasses (Expr, Stmt subclasses)
  parser.py        # list[Token] -> AST (Pratt parsing for expressions)
  errors.py        # CinderError hierarchy: LexError, ParseError, RuntimeError
  interpreter.py    # tree-walking evaluator, Environment (scoping)
  builtins.py       # standard library functions (print, len, type, ...)
  cli.py           # argparse entrypoint: run a script or launch REPL
  repl.py          # interactive read-eval-print loop
tests/
  test_lexer.py
  test_parser.py
  test_interpreter.py
  test_builtins.py
  test_errors.py
  ... (mirrors cinder/ package, one test module per source module)
examples/
  *.cin            # sample programs (fizzbuzz, fibonacci, etc.)
```

Design principles:
- **No dependencies beyond the Python 3 standard library.** `argparse` for
  the CLI, `unittest` for tests, `dataclasses` for AST nodes.
- **Every layer is independently unit-tested.** The lexer is tested without
  the parser; the parser is tested against token lists or AST shape, not by
  round-tripping through the interpreter.
- **Errors are structured, not stringly-typed.** `CinderError` subclasses
  carry line/column; the CLI formats them for humans, tests assert on the
  structured fields.
- **AST nodes are immutable dataclasses**, one class per grammar production.
- **Truthiness is fixed and narrow**: `false` and `nil` are falsy; every other
  value — including `0`, `0.0`, and `""` — is truthy. This governs `if`,
  `while`, `and`/`or` short-circuiting, and `not`, and must not change without
  amending this document.
- **A leading `{` at statement position is disambiguated by speculative
  parse**: the parser first attempts a full expression parse rooted in a
  map literal (covering postfix indexing/calls and binary operators applied
  to it, e.g. `{"a": 1};`, `{"a": 1}["a"];`, `{"a": 1} == {"a": 1};`); if
  that fails, it falls back to parsing a `{ <statement>* }` block. Empty
  `{}` is always an empty Block, never an empty map literal.

## Tech stack

- Python 3.14 (stdlib only — see Dependencies rule in `CLAUDE.md`)
- `unittest` for tests (`python3 -m unittest discover -s tests`)
- `argparse` for the CLI

## How to run

```sh
# All commands run from this project's directory: projects/cinder/
cd projects/cinder

# Run a script
python3 -m cinder.cli run examples/fizzbuzz.cin

# Start the REPL
python3 -m cinder.cli repl
```

(The exact CLI subcommands/entrypoint may be refined by the scaffolding task
— treat the above as intent, not a locked interface.)

## How to test

```sh
cd projects/cinder
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

`main` must always be green under this command. QA runs this in full for
every PR, not just tests touching the new code.

## Roadmap (beyond current backlog)

The core interpreter (lexer through error handling, functions/closures,
lists/maps, destructuring, comprehensions, errors-with-line/col, a
100+-function standard library, and a REPL) has been solid for many
nights now. Every landed feature's own PR and the reasoning behind it is
recorded in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md), in merge order — that file,
not this section, is the authoritative history. This section stays
short on purpose: it used to accumulate one paragraph of prose per
grooming pass narrating exactly what `CHANGELOG.md` already records,
which made this document (the thing every session needs to read for
vision/scope) grow by hundreds of lines a night for no reader's benefit.
Trimmed back on 2026-08-22 — see the History entry below.

### Backlog policy

The backlog (`BACKLOG.md`) is kept at 5-6 ready tasks, alternating
between two kinds of work:

- **Depth tasks** grow the language itself — syntax, operators, control
  flow, the destructuring/comprehension machinery. These usually touch
  `cinder/parser.py`, `cinder/ast_nodes.py`, and `cinder/interpreter.py`
  together.
- **Breadth tasks** grow the standard library — one new `cinder/builtins.py`
  function at a time (numeric-property predicates, string predicates,
  collection helpers, and similar).

Each grooming pass alternates: after a depth task lands, restock with a
breadth task, and vice versa. Occasionally two of the same kind stack
back-to-back when a pass would otherwise leave the backlog thin — that's
fine, alternation is the default rhythm, not a hard rule. Whenever a
merge drops the backlog to its 5-task floor, the next grooming pass
renumbers the remaining tasks starting at 1 and adds one new task to
bring the count back to 6.

### Current frontier

Recently landed (see `CHANGELOG.md` for the full list): a map pattern
nested inside a list pattern (#297), `is_hexagonal` (#298), a list
pattern nested inside a map pattern (#299), `is_heptagonal` (#300), a
step component for range expressions (#301), and `collatz_max` (#303).
`BACKLOG.md` carries the active queue: a `match` expression with
literal patterns and a `_` wildcard, `nth_prime`, `nth_fibonacci`, bare
comma multi-target assignment (`a, b = 1, 2;`), `is_octagonal`, and
`binomial`.

With PR #299 landing, destructuring patterns now support arbitrary
composition of list- and map-shaped nesting in any order — every corner
of that matrix (list-in-list, map-in-map, map-in-list, list-in-map) is
closed for good. The `match`-expression task already queued opens the
next depth arc — pattern matching beyond destructuring — deliberately
scoped small (literal patterns and a wildcard only, no bindings or
guards yet); richer patterns (bound identifiers, nested/destructuring
patterns, multi-value arms, guards) are natural follow-ups once it
lands, for the Architect to sequence in future grooming passes rather
than commit to now — not before, since they'd extend `MatchArm`/
`MatchExpr` nodes that don't exist yet. The queued multi-target-assignment
task is a second, independent depth thread — sugar over existing
bracketed list-destructuring assignment, not part of the
pattern-matching arc — picked because the gap it closes is a real
correctness hole (today's parser silently misinterprets `a, b = 1, 2;`
as unrelated statements rather than raising or working).

This grooming pass restocked with `binomial` as a second breadth task
back-to-back with `is_octagonal` rather than alternating back to depth:
several depth candidates were checked against the live interpreter and
each either turned out to already exist (chained comparisons — `1 < 2 <
3` already parses via `ChainedComparison` in `cinder/parser.py`'s
`_comparison`, evaluating `and`-joined pairwise, not left-associative
bool-as-int coercion; `to_fixed(value, digits)` for fixed-decimal
number formatting already exists in `cinder/builtins.py`) or would open
a genuinely ambiguous grammar question not safely scoped to one session
(a format-spec suffix on string interpolation, `${value:.2f}`, collides
with the ternary operator's own `:` at the same brace depth — resolving
it needs either a parser-level disambiguation design or a character-offset
scheme for slicing the raw spec text out of the interpolation's source,
either of which is a task of its own, not a one-line addition). Rather
than force a thin or risky depth task into the queue, this pass took the
verified, unambiguous breadth gap instead — the backlog policy's
"occasionally two of the same kind stack back-to-back" clause exists
for exactly this case. The next grooming pass should return to depth;
a format-spec suffix on string interpolation remains a plausible future
depth task once someone designs the disambiguation properly, not
attempted here.

## History

- **2026-07-18** — Project invented (Night One). No prior product existed;
  only the nightshift orchestrator scaffolding. Chose a from-scratch
  language interpreter for its natural incremental structure and zero
  external dependencies.
- **2026-08-22** — Trimmed the "Roadmap" section from ~1790 lines of
  accumulated per-cycle prose (one paragraph appended every grooming
  pass narrating each landed PR) down to a short policy statement plus
  a pointer to `CHANGELOG.md`, which already recorded the exact same
  history in full detail. Same rationale as the 2026-07-30
  `BACKLOG.md`/`CHANGELOG.md` split: nobody should have to read a
  wall of finished history to find current vision/scope, and this
  document's unbounded growth was costing every session that read it.
